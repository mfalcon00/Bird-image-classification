# Bird-image-classification

Project team :  [Fabiha Chowdhury](https://github.com/Fabihachow) and [Marjorie Falcon](https://github.com/mfalcon00)

Dataset used : Bird Species dataset from Kaggle.

The dataset contains:
20 bird species
3208 training images, 100 test images(5 images per species)
100 validation images (5 images per species)
Your goal is to build an image classification model with the best possible performance. You will work in a group, and at the end, as a group you will present your work to your instructor and classmates.

Requirements:
Compile a classification model (you can choose any image classification model you want).
Your accuracy should be at least 85%
Save your final model, and use the images in "images to predict" to evaluate its performance during the group presentation
Save your final work in a public Github repository
Tips:
Use Google Colab for larger/more complex models
Consider using data augmentation to improve your model's performance
Make sure to read the datasets Data Card to get a better understanding of the images and the structure/dimensions of the files
Good Luck!Â¶
