# Bird-image-classification

The requirement was to compile a classification model obtaining an accuracy of, at least 85%. Additionally, the images in "images to predict" were to be used to evaluate the performance of the model.
The dataset used is the [Bird Species](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/umairshahpirzada/birds-20-species-image-classification/data dataset from Kaggle).

The dataset contains 20 bird species, including :
- 3208 training images,
- 100 test images(5 images per species)
- 100 validation images (5 images per species)
